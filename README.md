# Song-Recommendation-Based-On-Mood
CSCI 4930 Machine Learning 
University of Colorado - Denver

The goal behind this project is to create a facial recognition algorithm that can detect a person’s mood from a picture. We will detect the four most common moods: happy, sad, angry, and neutral. The algorithm will then make a song recommendation based on the person’s mood. Although music preference in relation to mood is subjective, we will use sources 1 that have made links between moods and music genres. Since there are many music genres, we will limit the recommendations to the top 10 most common.
